INTRODUCTION:
------------

Hello and thank you for purchasing our 10 modern Game Backgrounds (1024x512). These backgrounds are 100% vector and tileable horizontally.

This set includes vector files (AI and EPS) as well as PNG (full + layered backgrounds).

We truly hope that you will enjoy these awesome backgrounds and use them in all your amazing projects.


Checking Backgrounds in the Illustrator / EPS files:
--------------------------------------------------

In order to make the size of our product smaller, we have added all backgrounds inside one AI / EPS file.

When you open the AI file, use the right "layers panel" to navigate inside the list of backgrounds and find the one you want to use. 

Then simply click on the "eye" icon (left side of the layer) to display the background.

If you want to "hide" it again, click on the "eye" icon again.


Tips: You can click on the small arrows (left side of the layers) in order to hide/display all the "sub layers".





Please feel free to contact us via our email (sales@flat-icons.com) if you need our help.


We wish you an amazing day.
